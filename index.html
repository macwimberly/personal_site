                    <p id="bioLong">In my prior life I worked at a too big to fail financial firm in San Francisco. I worked with clients in the ultra high net-worth segment. Many of these clients were tech CEOs, or, very accomplished software engineers for companies like CISCO and GOOGLE. I origionally moved into finanace on the advice of a family friend with a philosohy background. Despite completing a few computer science classes in college I ultimately decided to study philsophy. I liked discussing big picture questions and programming seemed too granular at the time. I had never really considered finanace but it turned out to be a pretty good fit. I loved watching the market fluctuate as big picture social and politcal events unfolded. I could track a dry growing season in the American Midwest to the strengthing of the New Zealand dollar. I also enjoyed distilling these macro events down to the basic trends our clients were seeing reflected in their portfolio perfomance. I began my journey in 2007 right as the market started to dive. Trying to explain how scary it was to be a complete rookie learning the finance trade as markets plummeted everywhere is difficult. Imagine, you have just passed your liscense exams and your boss leaves you alone on the phones for the first time while he heads off to a meeting and your other team members are all off the desk. It's just you and your comptuer and the phone rings. You answer the phone, it's a client calling from Australia, spooked and asking you to liqidate his entire five million dollar portfolio immediately. Contrary to what you see in the movies it is not a common occurance to dump an entire portfolio in a single afternoon. It is impossible to predit market movements and generally speaking you try to temper market volitility by spreading out major sells over time utilizing a strategy. You glance at the clock, the stock exchanges close in 15 mins. You try to conference in the boss to talk the client down but he's not answering. Keep in mind you are legally required to enter the sale orders once the client makes the request. If you delay the entry of the sale orders until the next morning and overnight markets continue to dive your team is responsible for the difference. In this case, an overnight decline of just one percent would put the team on the hook for fifty-thousand dollars. However, in 2008 there were plenty of days where markets tumbled over five percent, that type of decline could result in a loss of two-hundred-fifty thousand dollars. You start feeling nausceous. n this case fee You are now alone but I don One of my favorite parts of my job was was seeing the incemental progress these client's made on new feature in service they were rolling out. Frequently, I would try to wrap my brain around some of the technical jargon they threw around during meetings by scribbling notes and later searching the web. </p>
