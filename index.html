                        In my previous life I worked on an elite asset management team at a too big to fail financial firm building relationships with clients in the ultra high-net-worth segment as a Senior Client Associate. I served as the lead point of contact for all client communications & investment and our clients represented some of Silicon Valley's best and brightest engineers and investors. One day, after a meeting focused on funding a client's new startup venture I realized I was much more interested in the development of the software platform than merely securing financing for it. I soon resigned and moved to Austin. At the time of my departure I was ranked the #1 Top Performing Client Associate in San Francisco office, #4 in region, and #23 nationally out of a pool of more than 300 associates. Once in Austin, I completed a 16-week web development immersive that was very challenging. I logged over 450 hours in the classroom, 250 on assignments, and built 4 applications and presented each to a panel of senior software developers from Austin area tech companies. Throughout my immersive I relied on much of my past experience to succeed. <p>My background in Philosophy had given me a respect for concise logic and organized argumentation, concepts that are paramount to writing good code. The critical thinking and technical writing skills I had honed not only gave me the ability to learn quickly, they made things like pseudo coding and reading documentation second nature. I was also adaptable, programming presented some unique challenges and utilizing development specific principals such as modularity, separation of concerns, dry code, and the open/closed and single responsibility principles meant I had a complete foundation upon which I could build my skills.</p>
                         <p>From my experience in asset management and work alongside Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I learned to see software from the side of managers and investors as a product competing for market share. Coding is a creative endeavor but at the end of the day it needed to address an issue and provide a profitable and robust solution. I also acquired excellent relationship-building skills garnered from years of working in high stress situations with clients and their accountants, attorneys, and employees.</p> <p>I had started in finance just a few months before the market crash of 2008. As the greater market declined and chipped away at portfolio valuations things got very real very quickly. On more than one morning I rode the elevator up to the 21st floor praying I would not get sick inside the small enclosure. I was pushed to my limits almost daily and many times I wanted to quit. Each day I worked with advisors to develop and present defensive strategies to counter the downward market trajectory. I had to learn to assess and address the unique concerns and fears of each client, some were worried because a large portion of their portfolio was comprised of shares of the company they built and did not want to let go of, others felt powerless as they had investments that were illiquid and at the mercy of market forces. I once had to talk a client off the ledge when I was alone on the desk and he called from Australia in a panic and wanted to liquidate his $4M mutual fund account right then and there. I had some very tough conversations and though it all I consider my ability to listen and connect with others to be the primary reason for my success. I have a very serious appreciation for service and empathy and I rely on those values to guide my interpersonal and business relationships.</p>
                         <p>Today I am immersed in anything and everything web. I especially enjoy the magic of front-end development and the greater depth and complexity brought to it via the recent explosion of front-end frameworks. I am currently looking for positions in the Austin area with organizations that appreciate my background and can further develop my skillset. Please give me shout if you need someone who is already excellent with clients and on his way to becoming an excellent coder!</p>
