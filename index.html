                    <div id="bioLong">
                        <p>
                            <p>I began my career in finance just before the market crash of 2008 in San Francisco with Merrill Lynch Private Banking and Investment Group. I built strong relationships with clients in the ultra high net-worth segment working as a Senior Client Associate on an elite asset management team. We managed investment portfolios with a $10M minimum requirement for Silicon Valley's best and brightest engineers and investors. I served as the lead point of contact for all client communications and investments. During those first few years I was pushed to my limits almost daily. People were losing their jobs and companies were collapsing. Our team made many tough choices and maintaining our client’s confidence was essential. Protecting portfolios from the tumbling markets and reassuring our clients that our defensive strategies were sound took all the technical and interpersonal abilities I possessed. Through it all, my commitment to excellent service, trust in my team members, and empathy for a client’s concerns were most integral to my success. During my tenure we lost only one client and added more than 10 to our roster. I was ranked the Top Performing Client Associate in the San Francisco office, #4 in region, and #23 nationally out of a pool of over 500 talented individuals.</p>
                            <p> I left my too big to fail financial firm after markets rebounded. I had considered a change for some time but it was during a client meeting that I finally decided it was time to move on. As we sat together discussing financing for his small start-up I realized I was on the wrong side of the table. I was much more interested in his project than merely securing financing for it and moving on. I wanted to be part of a team building something more tangible than a stock portfolio. I wanted to build software and learn how to write code. I soon resigned and relocated to Austin.</p>
                            <p>I wanted to learn to code at an accelerated pace so enrolled in a 16-week web development immersive with General Assembly in Austin. The immersive was tough. Long hours coupled with an immense amount of information meant no socializing and no family, only coding. By the end I had logged over 450 hours in the classroom and 300 hours on assignments. I built 4 applications and presented each to a panel of senior software developers from Austin area companies. Throughout the program I relied on much of my past experience to succeed and learn new skills.</p>
                            <p>I received my undergrad degree in Philosophy from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 2006. My work in Philosophy had given me a respect for concise logic and organized argumentation, concepts that are paramount to writing good code. My critical thinking and technical writing skills gave me the ability to learn quickly making things like pseudo-coding and navigating documentation second nature. I was also adaptable: understanding programming principals such as modularity, separation of concerns, and dry code etc., flexed the creative and analytical thinking skills so integral to mastering dense philosophical manuscripts.</p>
                            <p>From my experience in asset management working alongside Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I learned to see software from the side of managers and investors as a product competing for market share. Coding is a creative endeavor but at the end of the day it needs to be produced in an efficient manner providing a profitable and robust solution to a clearly defined problem. I discovered that planning, time management, and successful teamwork was key to application development. Constant reassessment in light of the major project goals was a continual need: Sometimes I had to abandon an unessential feature or at other times seek help when I hit a roadblock. I am proud that I was one of only a few students who presented all four applications, with each displaying core functionality.</p>
                            <p>I really loved all the little victories I experienced coding with General Assembly. On my first project I spent a lot of time optimizing a Simpson’s themed tic-tac-toe game for browser and mobile. I learned to manage the audio files so they ran cross-platform. I learned the ins-and-outs of working with media queries; it was a lot of work. Fast forward to presentation day and it turns out that people don’t find tic-tac-toe the least bit enthralling no matter how many fun sounds it makes or how many different screen sizes it scales to. I learned that you couldn’t make up for up a boring concept by building a flashy interface on top of it. From then on I tried to focus on building projects with more complex functionality, spending less time on the beauty of the user interface. My subsequent project used a NoSQL database to store and retrieve random quotes totaling 133 characters or less, great for sending smart sounding tweets with the Twitter API. That application was much better received due to the increased time I put into developing the concept and more complex logic. I learned so much over those 16 weeks. I was excited to finally be participating in projects from the development side.</p>
                            <p>Today I am immersed in everything web. I especially enjoy working in JS and the magic of front-end development. I am currently looking for roles in the Austin area with organizations that appreciate my background in relationship building and can further develop my coding skills.
